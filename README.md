# SkillPassport - Minimal Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend that demonstrates MetaMask login and a post-login UI with three role options: Employee, Employer, and Institute.

## What you get

- Connect with MetaMask (uses ethers v6 BrowserProvider)
- After connecting, a screen with 3 options (Employee, Employer, Institute)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser

## Run (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\skillpassport"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the displayed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in a browser with MetaMask installed.

## Next steps (ideas)

- Add routing for role-specific pages
- Wire up smart contract interactions
- Add network checks and chain switching
